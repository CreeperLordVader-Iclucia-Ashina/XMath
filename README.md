# XMath

### XMath is a small math library under dev. It will be used in mainly graphics and signals.

#### Features and functions will be added to the library as I learn more and more math :)

#### I plan to add functions of linear algebra, mathematical analysis, convex optimization, numerical method and even geometry to this.

#### Other wheels in signals and systems and so on are also considered.

#### But so far I have only implemented a simple Matrix Class :(
